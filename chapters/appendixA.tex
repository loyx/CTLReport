\chapter{CTL Grammar}
The grammar of CTL uses the EBNF(Extended Backus-Naur Form), where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item symbol $[\dots]$ indicates that the items in square brackets is optional;
    \item symbol $\{\dots\}$ indicates that the items in curly braces can be repeated 0 or more times;
    \item Terminators are either single-quoted strings or in $\mb{bold}$.
\end{itemize}
The grammar of the CTL is represented as follows, where $program$ is the start symbol.
$$
program \rightarrow \mb{hhh} | asd
$$
